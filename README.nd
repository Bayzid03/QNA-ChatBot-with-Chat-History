Gemini Streamlit Chatbot

A simple question and answer chatbot application built with Streamlit and the Google Gemini Flash API. This application allows users to interact with the Gemini model through a web interface and keeps track of the conversation history.

Features

* Simple web-based interface using Streamlit.
* Interacts with the Google Gemini Flash (preview) model.
* Maintains and displays the chat history within the current session.
* Easy to set up and run.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Python: Version 3.7 or higher.
* pip: Python package installer.
* Google AI API Key: Obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/Bayzid03/QNA-ChatBot-with-Chat-History>
    cd <>
    ```
2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  Activate the virtual environment:**
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  Install the required packages:
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory as your Python script (`app.py` or similar) with the following content:
    ```
    streamlit
    google-generativeai
    python-dotenv # Recommended for managing API key securely
    ```
    Then, install the packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Configuration

1.  Set your Google AI API Key:
    The application reads the API key from the environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
    * Using `.env` file (Recommended for local development):**
        Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project with the following content:
        ```dotenv
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        ```
        Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API key you obtained. Ensure you have `python-dotenv` installed (`pip install python-dotenv`) and add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

    * Setting environment variable directly (Temporary or for deployment):
        * On Windows (Command Prompt):
            ```bash
            set GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
            ```
        * On Windows (PowerShell):
            ```powershell
            $env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
            ```
        * On macOS and Linux:
            ```bash
            export GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
            ```
        *(Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. Note that setting it this way is temporary and only lasts for the current terminal session unless added to your shell profile.)*

## How to Run

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Ensure the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable is set.
3.  Run the Streamlit application from the terminal in the project directory:
    ```bash
    streamlit run <QnA_ChatBot>.py
    ```
    This will open the application in your web browser.
